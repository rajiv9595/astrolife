                "content": "Vedic Astrology, or **Jyotish** (the Science of Light), is the eye of the Vedas. It is an ancient system of knowledge from India that dates back over 5,000 years. Unlike Western astrology which uses the Tropical Zodiac (based on Seasons), Vedic Astrology uses the **Sidereal Zodiac** (based on the actual position of stars). This makes it highly predictive and structurally different. It believes in the law of Karma—that our soul chooses a birth time to experience specific lessons."

Vedic philosophy categorizes human existence into four goals:\n1. **Dharma** (Righteousness & Duty): Doing what is morally right.\n2. **Artha** (Wealth & Resources): Acquiring material stability.\n3. **Kama** (Desire & Enjoyment): Experiencing emotional and sensory pleasure.\n4. **Moksha** (Liberation): The ultimate goal of freeing the soul from the cycle of rebirth.\n\nYour horoscope reveals which of these aims is dominant in your current life."
